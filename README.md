# 🎲 Ludo Dice Game (React)

A simple Ludo-style dice game built using **React** to practice **useState**, event handling, and state management with objects.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Players: Blue, Yellow, Green, and Red
- 🎲 Dice roll gives a random number between 1 and 6
- 🏁 First player to reach 100 points wins
- 🔄 "Reset" button to restart the game
- 💡 Real-time score updates and move tracking

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- React (Functional Components)

- useState Hook
- Basic CSS

## 📚 What I Learned

- Updating nested state safely using the spread operator (`...prev`)
- Conditional rendering and game logic
- React re-rendering behavior and state immutability
- Basic component structuring in React
