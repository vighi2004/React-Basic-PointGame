# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# 🎲 Ludo Dice Game (React)

A simple Ludo-style dice game built using **React** to practice **useState**, event handling, and state management with objects.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Players: Blue, Yellow, Green, and Red
- 🎲 Dice roll gives a random number between 1 and 6
- 🏁 First player to reach 100 points wins
- 🔄 "Reset" button to restart the game
- 💡 Real-time score updates and move tracking

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- React (Functional Components)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- useState Hook
- Basic CSS

## 📚 What I Learned

- Managing complex state using objects (`useState({ blue: 0, ... })`)
- Updating nested state safely using the spread operator (`...prev`)
- Conditional rendering and game logic
- React re-rendering behavior and state immutability
- Basic component structuring in React
